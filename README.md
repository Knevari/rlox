# Rlox

This is a Lox programming language interpreter written in Rust, I had been thinking about reading the Crafting Interpreters book by Robert Nystrom for some time, but going back to Java after so many years would only get me some terrible flashbacks I wouldn't mind looking back to. Since I'm learning Rust on my free time I decided to give it a go and translate the book's code to this amazing and developer friendly language instead \s :).
